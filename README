                     [xmltv_files [xmltv_files ...]]

    Utility to inspect and manipulate XMLTV files.

    If -i, -c or -d are used, a summary of the input files is printed. Otherwise a resulting processed XMLTV is printed.

  -d, --print-days      inspect dates and per-day time coverage, implies -i.
  -p, --print-programs  inspect programs. implies -i
  -C FILTER_CHANNELS, --filter-channels FILTER_CHANNELS
                        filter by channels id (comma separated)
  -s SHIFT_TIME_ONWARDS, --shift-time-onwards SHIFT_TIME_ONWARDS
                        shift the start time dates onwards. Accepts time

  -S SHIFT_TIME_BACKWARDS, --shift-time-backwards SHIFT_TIME_BACKWARDS
                        shift the start time dates backwards. Accepts time
