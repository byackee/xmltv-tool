                     [xmltv_files [xmltv_files ...]]

    Utility to inspect and manipulate XMLTV files.

    If -i, -c or -d are used, a summary of the input files is printed. Otherwise a resulting processed XMLTV is printed.

    Input files are merged into one before processing and printed as a valid merged XMLTV file.
    

positional arguments:
  xmltv_files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --inspect         print stats about the files instead of the resulting
                        file. Equivalent to -cd
  -D, --debug           print debug statements during the execution of the
                        program
  -c, --print-channels  inspect channels, implies -i.
  -d, --print-days      inspect dates and per-day time coverage, implies -i.
  -p, --print-programs  inspect programs. implies -i
  -C FILTER_CHANNELS, --filter-channels FILTER_CHANNELS
                        filter by channels id (comma separated)
  -f FILTER_CHANNELS_FILE, --filter-channels-file FILTER_CHANNELS_FILE
                        filter by channels id loading channels from the file
                        (one per line)
  -s SHIFT_TIME_ONWARDS, --shift-time-onwards SHIFT_TIME_ONWARDS
                        shift the start time dates onwards. Accepts time
                        definitions as: 1d, 3M, 6y, 4w.
  -S SHIFT_TIME_BACKWARDS, --shift-time-backwards SHIFT_TIME_BACKWARDS
                        shift the start time dates backwards. Accepts time
                        definitions as --shift-time-onwards.
  -u, --utc             normalize start time to UTC
